Files to Run:

1. classifier_test_run.py
2. dqn_test_run.py - utilize the proper .pth file

dqn_best_model_excitebike.pth refers to the default DQN weights
dqn2_model_excitebike.pth refers to the DQN variant weights

Other Files:

- classifier_behavior.py (trains the classifier network)
- dqn_training.py (trains the default DQN network)
- dqn_two_arr.py (trains the variant DQN network)

Dependencies Setup:

You would need to set up custom integration to run the code.
On Linux:

- Install Gym Retro into Python3:
pip3 install gym-retro

- Unzip the custom-integration.zip folder

- Place custom-integration folder in same directory as the python files

This should allow the code in the python files to refer to the correct directory

Warning: Working with retro was tricky and I had to jump through many hoops to make it work.

I am therefore unsure if the above works. Testing was impossible due to alterations I made on my machine.

Please let me know if you are unable to verify my results. 

I also provide recording clips of the results. I hope that could help convince you of my work's legitimacy.
